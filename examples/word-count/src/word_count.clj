(comment
  ;; You can use this comment block to explore the Word Count
  ;; application.

  ;; This comment block introduces an interactive development
  ;; workflow. With only a few keystrokes, the application can be
  ;; reset, explored, modified, and then reset again [Note 1]. Using
  ;; this workflow, we can treat Kafka Streams apps much like we do
  ;; pure functions. We can supply inputs at the REPL, and we can
  ;; change them and see what they do.

  ;; [Note 1] Stuart Sierra, "My Clojure Workflow, Reloaded"
  ;; http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2013/06/04/clojure-workflow-reloaded


  ;; STEP 1: Download and Start Confluent Platform

  ;; For serious development, Confluent Platform can be supervised by
  ;; an operating system service manager, e.g., launchd or
  ;; systemd. However, if you want to get up and running quickly,
  ;; download the Confluent CLI from
  ;; `https://www.confluent.io/download/` and add the install location
  ;; to your PATH. Then start Confluent Platform using the Confluent
  ;; CLI `start` command.
  ;; ```
  ;; <path-to-confluent>/bin/confluent start
  ;; ```
  ;;
  ;; The Confluent CLI requires Java 8. If ZooKeeper and Kafka are
  ;; already running, skip this step.


  ;; STEP 2: Launch a Clojure REPL and Call `reset`

  ;; Install Clojure via your favorite package manager, e.g.,
  ;; Homebrew, APT, or DNF. Then change to the Word Count project
  ;; directory and start a REPL.
  ;;
  ;; For example, using Homebrew and the CLI tools:
  ;; ```
  ;; brew install clojure
  ;; cd <path-to-jackdaw>/examples/word-count
  ;; clj
  ;; ```
  ;;
  ;; You should see output like the following:
  ;; ```
  ;; Clojure 1.10.0
  ;; user=>
  ;; ```

  ;; Enter the following at the `user=>` prompt:
  (reset)

  ;; You should see output like the following indicating the topics
  ;; were created and the app is running.
  ;;
  ;; ```
  ;; 23:01:25.939 [main] INFO  system - internal state is deleted
  ;; 23:01:26.093 [main] INFO  word-count - word-count is up
  ;; {:app #object[org.apache.kafka.streams.KafkaStreams 0xb8b2184 "org.apache.kafka.streams.KafkaStreams@b8b2184"]}
  ;; ```

  ;; Emacs users:
  ;;
  ;; Install Cider (https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider). After
  ;; installing, open a project file, e.g. this one, and use
  ;; `M-x cider-jack-in` to start a REPL. You can evaluate forms using
  ;; `C-x C-e` and `C-c C-v C-f e`. The latter sends output to
  ;; *cider-results*.

  ;; The following `require` is needed because the functons to reset
  ;; app state and produce and consume records are defined in the
  ;; `user` namespace but we want to evaluate them from this one.

  ;; Evaluate the form using `C-x C-e`:
  (require '[user :refer :all])

  ;; Evaluate the form using `C-c C-v C-f e`:
  (reset)

  ;; For the rest of the comment block, it is assumed you can evaluate
  ;; the forms. If you have a basic REPL, use copy-paste.


  ;; STEP 3: Publish Inputs and Get Outputs

  ;; Evaluate the form:
  (publish (:input (topic-metadata)) nil "all streams lead to kafka")

  ;; Evaluate the form:
  (publish (:input (topic-metadata)) nil "hello kafka streams")

  ;; Wait approximately five seconds, then evaluate the form:
  (get-keyvals (:output (topic-metadata)))

  ;; You should see output like the following:
  ;; ```
  ;; (["all" 1]
  ;;  ["streams" 1]
  ;;  ["lead" 1]
  ;;  ["to" 1]
  ;;  ["kafka" 1]
  ;;  ["hello" 1]
  ;;  ["kafka" 2]
  ;;  ["streams" 2])
  ;; ```

  ;; Notice the double occurances of "streams" and "kafka". This
  ;; happens because at an earlier point the count for each of these
  ;; was 'one' and then later became 'two'. To see only the current
  ;; counts, we can transform the result into a map.

  ;; Evaluate the form:
  (->> (get-keyvals (:output (topic-metadata)))
       (into {})
       (sort-by second)
       reverse)

  ;; You should see output like the following:
  ;; ```
  ;; (["kafka" 2]
  ;;  ["streams" 2]
  ;;  ["hello" 1]
  ;;  ["to" 1]
  ;;  ["lead" 1]
  ;;  ["all" 1])


  ;; This preceding example has a fairly small dataset. Let's make it
  ;; larger.


  ;; The classpath contains a copy of The Metamorphosis. We will load
  ;; and split the dataset by the newlines and publish the fragments
  ;; to `input` topic as separate records. As before, we get the
  ;; counts from the 'output' topic.

  ;; Evaluate the form:
  (reset)

  ;; Evaluate the form:
  (let [text-input (slurp (io/resource "metamorphosis.txt"))
        values (str/split text-input #"\n")]
    (doseq [v values]
      (publish (:input (topic-metadata)) nil v)
      (info v))
    (info "The End"))

  ;; Wait until the log contains "The End". Then evaluate the form:
  (->> (get-keyvals (:output (topic-metadata)))
       (into {})
       (sort-by second)
       reverse)

  ;; You should see output like the following:
  ;; ```
  ;; (["the" 1148]
  ;;  ["to" 753]
  ;;  ["and" 642]
  ;;  ["he" 590]
  ;;  ["his" 550]
  ;;  ["of" 429]
  ;;  ["was" 409]
  ;;  ["it" 370]
  ;;  ["had" 352]
  ;;  ["in" 348]
  ;;  ["that" 345]
  ;;  ["gregor" 298]
  ;;  ["a" 285]
  ;;  ["as" 242]
  ;;  ["she" 200]
  ;;  ["with" 199]
  ;;  ["s" 194]
  ;;  ["him" 188]
  ;;  ["her" 187]
  ;;  ["would" 187]
  ;;  ...)
  ;; ```
